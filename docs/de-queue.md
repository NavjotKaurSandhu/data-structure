## DeQueue:

1. The deque data structure, also known as the double-ended queue, is a special queue that allows us to insert and remove elements from the end or from the front of the queue. 
2. Eg: Movie theaters, Cafeterias, and so on.
3. Methods for DeQueue:
   * addFront(element): This method adds a new element at the front of the deque.
   * addBack(element): This method adds a new element at the back of the deque (same implementation as the enqueue method from the Queue class).
   * removeFront(): This method removes the first element from the deque (the same implementation as the dequeue method from the Queue class).
   * removeBack(): This method removes the last element from the deque (the same implementation as the pop method from the Stack class).
   * peekFront(): This method returns the first element from the deque (the same implementation as the peek method from the Queue class).
   * peekBack(): This method returns the last element from the deque (the same implementation as the peek method from the Stack class).
